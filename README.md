# ProductReview_WSD_Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) within product reviews, specifically addressing the challenge of interpreting ambiguous words in natural language processing tasks. Using a synthetic dataset of Samsung ZFold product reviews, we applied the Lesk Algorithm to identify and disambiguate multiple senses of key terms such as "light," "screen," "fold," and "fast." This repository includes the dataset, WSD implementation, analysis, and visualizations that demonstrate the importance of contextual information in resolving ambiguity.

## Key Achievements
- **Corpus Collection and Sense Identification**: Built a synthetic dataset with ambiguous terms and identified their senses using WordNet.
- **Lesk Algorithm Implementation**: Implemented the Lesk Algorithm to automate word sense disambiguation.
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Conducted a comprehensive analysis of word sense frequencies and patterns using Python libraries.
- **Insights on Ambiguity in NLP**: Explored the challenges of handling ambiguity in product reviews and emphasized the role of context in accurate disambiguation.

## Insights
- **Ambiguity Prevalence**: High occurrence of multi-sense words in product reviews highlights the need for effective WSD methods.
- **Contextual Importance**: Demonstrated that the Lesk Algorithmâ€™s effectiveness depends heavily on contextual clues.
- **Real-World Relevance**: Showcased practical applications of WSD in understanding customer feedback, sentiment analysis, and recommendation systems.

## Conclusion and Future Work
This project underscores the complexities of WSD in NLP tasks, particularly within product review contexts. Future work could involve exploring advanced machine learning techniques to improve disambiguation accuracy and efficiency.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NLTK
